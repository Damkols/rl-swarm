Layla requires 1 teaspoon of food for each Goldfish.
2 Goldfish * 1 teaspoon = 2 teaspoons
Layla also needs 2 teaspoons of food for each Swordtail.
3 Swordtails * 2 teaspoons = 6 teaspoons
Lastly, 8 Guppies each need 0.5 teaspoon of food.
8 Guppies * 0.5 teaspoon = 4 teaspoons
Total food required = 2 teaspoons + 6 teaspoons + 4 teaspoons = 12 teaspoons
